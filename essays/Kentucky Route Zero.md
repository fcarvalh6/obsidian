## Act Zero

You are sitting in a dark room inside a television studio. There have been no broadcasts in years. The air is filled with powdery dust that's pierced by the light of the television in front of you. 

You are sitting on a metal folding chair in a dark room inside a television studio. The creaking is annoyingly distracting. You insert the tape, there's a loud click. A black screen, buzzing, the hairs in your arm rising, the cathode beams piercing you. A black screen, white letters that simply say "KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO."

A blank notebook, a blank video tape, a blank audio tape. Pick one place to leave your footsteps in and start. Two dark hands flank a circle of numbers and titles. A hairpin moves in the middle, it's shaking, everything is slowly spinning. You can choose all options but one. All acts, all intermissions, in whichever order you'd like, but the hairpin vibrates, there's a faint buzzing that grows louder and louder the closer you get to a thin white roman numeral, act one. You're drawn to it.

## Before we start

Kentucky Route Zero is the best game I have ever played. That is, if I can even call it a game. It mostly feels like a sequence of acts and scenes, strange dusty memories, vague dialogue and a thread that links us all together. It is, in many senses, closer to a collection of still-life paintings. These paintings, however, shift. They show themselves in different ways, they ask something of you. 

Tell us, what do you want? What would you say? There are games that pride themselves on branching stories, on making every single action have an impact on the outcome of your playthrough drastically. In these games, your choices allow you to impart changes unto the game. In this game, however, what you choose will do nothing to affect how the events unfold. Everything follows a set track and you can only watch. 

But the game still asks you what you want, it still asks you what you would say. Not so you can change the game, but so the game can change you. So it can give you the opportunity of choosing how you feel about what it shows you. You choose who you are outside of the game. 

This options sounds compassionate. This options sounds indifferent. This option sounds harsh. It will not affect the story, it will only affect the intangible way in which you feel while you play through this sequence of acts and intermissions. It's magical, it's surreal, it's deterministic. It's like appreciating art, like enjoying art, like consuming art... But none of these words really make sense. To appreciate implies there is a quality to what is being appreciated. To enjoy implies it can be enjoyed in the first place. To consume implies the act of consumption. 

It's like being in the presence of art. Art, which is at the same time a deep well and a mirror, and everything else, and nothing, an object, a sound, a thought. This *art-thing* in front of you asks you something, it's now possible to give your answer. Through electricity, through lines of code, a speech bubble, a dialogue option. Enough. Let's begin.
